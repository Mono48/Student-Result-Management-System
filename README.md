# Student Result Management System

## Project Overview
The Student Result Management System is a simple, console-based application developed as part of the SEN 201 (Software Engineering) assignment.  
The system allows users to enter student details, calculate grades based on scores, and display stored student results.

This project demonstrates the practical application of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from requirement analysis to retirement.

## Objectives
- To design and implement a simple software system
- To demonstrate understanding of SDLC phases
- To practice basic programming and GitHub usage

## System Features
- Add student details (name, matric number, score)
- Automatically calculate student grades
- Display all stored student results
- Simple menu-driven interface

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Requirement Analysis
The system was designed to manage basic student result records.  
User requirements include the ability to add students, calculate grades, and view results.

### 2. System Design
The system is designed using the following modules:
- `add_student()`
- `display_students()`
- `calculate_grade(score)`
- `main_menu()`

These modules interact to ensure smooth program execution.

### 3. Implementation
The system was implemented using the Python programming language.  
Each module defined in the design phase was implemented as a function in the code.

### 4. Testing
The system was tested by:
- Adding multiple student records
- Verifying correct grade calculation
- Displaying student information
- Handling invalid menu inputs

### 5. Deployment
The application was deployed by uploading the source code to a GitHub repository, making it accessible for review and use.

### 6. Maintenance
Future maintenance may include:
- Adding file or database storage
- Improving error handling
- Enhancing the user interface

### 7. Retirement
The system will be retired when it becomes obsolete or is replaced by a more advanced web-based or database-driven result management system.

## Technology Used
